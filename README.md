### Explanation of Enhancements

1. **Feature Toggles**: The JavaScript function `toggleDetails` allows users to click on each feature's name to expand and view additional details interactively.
2. **Technology Icons**: Icons are added for each technology, providing a visual indicator of the tech stack.
3. **Shields and Labels**: Additional badges highlight tools and frameworks.
4. **Dynamic Interaction**: The JavaScript script enables information toggling directly in the README. 

**Note**: JavaScript won‚Äôt run on GitHub‚Äôs markdown rendering directly. To achieve this effect live, you‚Äôd need to host this markdown on your website or use a GitHub Pages site. However, for a simple README, you may consider replacing the toggle details with simple expandable sections using markdown details syntax, like:

```markdown
<details>
  <summary>Employee Management</summary>
  - Quickly add, modify, and remove employee records, storing essential details and availability.
</details>
