To ensure the boxes appear correctly in your `README.md`, make sure to remove any extra characters around the backticks and use triple backticks without spaces or extra characters. Here’s exactly how it should look:

```markdown
### 🔧 Setup & Installation

#### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/jack-and-son-nails-spa.git
cd jack-and-son-nails-spa
```

#### 2. Set Up the Environment
- Ensure you have Python installed.
- Create and activate a virtual environment:
  ```bash
  python -m venv venv
  source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
  ```

#### 3. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Run the Application
```bash
flask run
```

#### 5. Access the Application
- Open [localhost](http://127.0.0.1:5000) in your browser to view the application.
```

### Explanation

1. Use three backticks (` ``` `) at the start and end of each code block.
2. Specify the language (`bash` in this case) directly after the opening triple backticks to enable syntax highlighting.
3. Ensure there are no spaces or extra characters before or after the backticks.

When you copy and paste this directly into your `README.md` file, it should display shaded boxes around each command block on GitHub.

💻 Usage
Employee Management: Go to the Employee page to add or modify employee details.
